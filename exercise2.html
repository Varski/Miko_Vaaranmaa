    <h1>World Rally Car</h1>
    <p> A World Rally Car is a racing automobile built to the specific regulations set by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and designed for competition in the World Rally Championship (WRC). 
        The cars were introduced in 1997 as a replacement for Group A regulations used in the manufacturers' championship,[1] and were replaced by Group Rally1 in 2022.</p>

        The 1.6 L turbo-charged global race engine was retained in the 2017 World Rally Car regulations, but the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine's power output from 230 to 280 kW (310 to 380 hp). 
        The minimum empty vehicle weight was decreased by 10 kg but the combined vehicle, crew and spare wheel weight remained at 1360 kg.[10]
